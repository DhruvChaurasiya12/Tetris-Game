# Tetris-Game
A Tetris game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript recreates the classic falling block puzzle. It features a grid-based game board, smooth animations, and keyboard controls for moving and rotating blocks. The game speeds up over time, includes a score system, and uses CSS styling for a modern, responsive design.
